Q. What is up with libspf2?
A. If I had a penny for every email received with this question I'd be 
   filthy stinking rich.  Instead, i'm filthy stinking disgusted with the
   absolute arrogance displayed by Wayne Schlitt and "Shevek" aka Ben
   Mankin.  Wayne through his own arrogance believes that his library
   (originally entitled libspf-alt) is vastly superior to that of this 
   library that he deemed it appropriate to rename his library libspf2
   which causes a variety of problems.

   1. Its confusing!  Which library shall people use!?
      Wayne hopes that people will do the natual thing and assume that 
      by the very nature of it having a higher number (2) then that of
      libSPF they will use it.  Their own website references libSPF
      as 'An Old implementation."

   2. It appears to supercede or deprecate this library which is MORE
      MATURE and STABLE then libspf-alt/libspf2!

   3. Its inconsiderate and WRONG.  If you have a peek at the libs
      available with any *nix you will see that libraries with the name
      library2 eg: libxml2 are penned by the SAME author(s) and they do
      indeed generally deprecate the previous library.  Persons labeling
      their project as such without the consent of the original author
      are assholes.

   4. September 2, 2004 - Another good reason, this will be the third
      rewrite of an SPF implementation of Wayne origin.

      http://www.gossamer-threads.com/lists/spf/devel/11120

      In summary the entire library has been effectively rewritten once
      again.  Amusingly enough its merely now attempting to do just
      what this library has been doing from day one.  

   This is nasty disgusting political topic which I have tried to resolve
   but have had no success.

Q. Where are the patches against the MTAs?
A. See the patches directory.

Q. I/We/My company wants to pay you to help/integrate libspf/libsrs into our
   MTA.  Are you available?
A. Money is always great.  Email jcouzens@codeshare.ca.

Q. I want to help, where do I apply?
A. E-Mail jcouzens@codeshare.ca.  The most needed help is patches for MTA's.

Q. I have a patch against MTA X, what do I do?
A. Email jcouzens@codeshare.ca and arrange to communicate.

Q. I see debug code all over the place, but I can't get it working:
A. libspf-1_0_0/docs/API/debugging_libspf.pdf 

Q. make test fails for me
A. Its hard coded to use /usr/bin/perl where most if not all BSD and Linux
   implementations place the perl binary.  The easiest way around this is
   to symlink wherever you may have perl installed to this location.  An example
   of this would be: ln -s /usr/local/bin/perl /usr/bin/perl

Q. I have some random question not answered here.
A. Eamil jcouzens@codeshare.ca.

Q. Great work, I want to show my appreciation, how can I?
A. I love books.  Perhaps you could purchase something from my Amazon.com wishlist!
   If you do, please notify me so I can remove an item, no need getting two of
   anything :-)
