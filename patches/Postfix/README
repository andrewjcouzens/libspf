Desc: libSPF 1.0 patching Postfix README document

Postfix+libSPF

Patches are in subdirectories named according to the version of
Postfix that they were made against.

2.1.x - Patches against the 2.1.x versions of Postfix

You are pretty much on your own for now until a HOWTO is ready,
if you are capable, feel free to submit one!  For now the
following will have to do:

Unpack postfix v2.1.4 (or something close I suppose).

cd postfix-2.1.4
make

once its done making apply the patch:

patch -p1 < ../libspf-1.0.0/patches/Postfix/2.1.x/postfix-2.1.4-libspf-1.0-RC6.diff

Output should look something like this:

patching file include/mail_params.h
patching file src/global/mail_params.h
patching file src/smtpd/smtpd.c
patching file src/smtpd/smtpd_check.c
patching file src/smtpd/smtpd_state.c
patching file src/smtpd/Makefile
patching file src/smtpd/smtpd.h
patching file conf/spf.cf.example

Then:

make clean && make

Do whatever you normally would do with a Postfix installation...I must
apologize I'm not exceptionally familiar with it since I prefer qmail
and haven't had to look elsewhere since.

If you are familiar with Postfix then you will find conf/spf.cf.example
particularly comforting.
