First time doing this?  Read the Sendmail+libSPF HOWTO available within the
structure of the package this README should have come from, or alternatively 
on-line @ http://libspf.org/HOWTO/sendmail-8.13.1+libspf-1.0-HOWTO.html

sendmail.cf CONFIG VAR:

SPFAction

Inside this file place a single digit between 0 and 7.

Below describes the behaviour of these digits:

0: disabled
1: enabled (only prepends headers, and only if spfheaderstate == 1)
2: REJECT: fail; ACCEPT: pass, none, fail, error, netural, unknown; 
3: REJECT: fail, softfail; ACCEPT: pass, none, error, netural, unknown;
4: REJECT: fail, softfail, neutral; ACCEPT: pass, none, error, unknown;
5: REJECT: fail, softfail, neutral, none; ACCEPT: pass, error, unknown;
6: REJECT: fail, softfail, neutral, none, error; ACCEPT: pass, unknown;
7: REJECT: fail, softfail, neutral, none, error, unknown; ACCEPT: pass;

Chose one of the above error levels that best suits you.  I recommend 1.

================================================================================

sendmail.cf CONFIG VAR:

SPFHeaderState

value (single integer):

1 (default) = enabled prepending Received-SPF: headers
0 = no not prepend headers

When set to 1, libspf will pre-pend "Received-SPF:" headers as per the SPF RFC
Internet Draft.  This are useful for third party applications such as 
SpamAssassin, and even email clients capable of parsing headers to know where 
to filter email to. 

================================================================================

sendmail.cf CONFIG VAR:

SPFBestGuess

value: (single line of text)

default: v=spf1 a/24 mx/24 ptr 

This query is looked up in an attempt to make a guess against the user in the 
event no record is found and the trusted forwarder lookup fails.  The default 
value exists within libspf, so creating the sendmail.cf CONFIG VAR is only 
necessary if you wish to change this value.

================================================================================

sendmail.cf CONFIG VAR:

SPFBestGuessState

value (single integer):

1 (default) = perform best guess lookup when all else fails
0 = do not perofrm best best guess lookups.

When an SPF query fails, and then subsequently a trusted forwarder query 
possibly fails, libspf will attempt to perform a "best guess" query using a 
default string which can  be redefined using the 'spfguess' sendmail.cf 
CONFIG VAR.  The default value exists within libspf, so creating the 
sendmail.cf CONFIG VAR is only necessary if you wish to change this value. 

================================================================================

sendmail.cf CONFIG VAR:

SPFExplain

value (single line of text)

default: See http://spf.pobox.com/why.html?sender=%{S}&ip=%{I}&receiver=%{xR}

This string (can include macros) is expanded and sent to the client for every
result case excluding pass.  The default value exists within libspf, so 
creating the control file is only necessary if you wish to change this value.

================================================================================

sendmail.cf CONFIG VAR:

SPFExplainState

value (single integer): 

1 (default) = append explanation
0 = do not append explanation

When set to 1, explanations will be automatically printed out after any spf 
query excluding pass.  This information is designed to be informative and 
helpful to a user who has just likely had his or her email rejected.  See the 
above 'spfexplain' to define your own string to use instead.  The default value
exists within libspf, so creating the sendmail.cf CONFIG VAR is only necessary
if you wish to change this value.

When set to 0, explanations are not appended.

================================================================================

sendmail.cf CONFIG VAR:

SPFTrustedForwarder

value (single line of text)

default: v=spf1 include:spf.trusted-forwarder.org

This string (can include macros) is expanded and is used in the event that 
a connecting client's query results in NONE (no SPF record published).  libspf
will then (if enabled) attempt to contact trusted-forwarder.org (default) 
which is a global whitelisting system.  You can add additional sites, or provide
your own.  The default value exists within libspf, so creating the sendmail.cf
CONFIG VAR is only necessary if you wish to change this value.

================================================================================

sendmail.cf CONFIG VAR:

SPFTrustedForwarderState

value (single integer):

1 (default) = enabled trusted forwarder lookups
0 = no not perform trusted forwarder lookups

When set to 1, libspf will attempt to contact the site contained within that 
text, which would be ideally a whitelisting site (anything can really go there, 
but this particular file is here specifically to handle larger whitelisting 
services) that would be contacted in the event an SPF query returns NONE. 
The default value exists within libspf, so creating the sendmail.cf CONFIG VAR
is only necessary if you wish to change this value.
