Revision history for libspf

	- spfmilter was referenced by configure.in, but wasn't part
          of the latest tarball - discontinued?
	- applied patch by kd6lvw@yahoo.com to support SPF record
          types in addition to TXT records.
        - added default definition of T_SPF when it isn't define'd.
        - fixed a lot of minor mistakes in configure.in.
	- this version is currently (temporarily...) maintained
          by Marc Lehmann <libspf@schmorp.de>.
