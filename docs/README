Desc: README for libSPF 1.0 documentation 

libSPF documentation is broken down into the following components.
Firstly there is API documentation which consists of a Doxygen
doc tree, as well as pieces submitted by the authors of this 
library.


history     - History (deprecated documentation but still useful)

              - You'll find all the old CHANGELOG's within this dir

API         - Application Programming Interface

              - DOXYGEN

                - A DOXYGEN tree which encompasses the entire library
                  breaking apart every function, type, define etc..
                  and creating hyperlinks all throughout the pages
                  allowing you to easily discover where a particular 
                  piece of information originates whilst reviewing the
                  literal code or broken down explanations and
                  definitions of each.

              - debugging_libspf_1.0.pdf

                - A comprehensive document on how to interact with
                  the libSPF debugging factility

              - api_cache.html  

                - A short, but informative article which talk sbaout the
                  DNS caching available within libSPF and why the cache
                  is implemented the way it is (AVL-Tree instead of the
                  commonly used hash table).

RFC           - Requests for Comments

                - This is the technical document used as a roadmap for
                  libSPF.  It describes the ways SPF may be implemented
                  from the optional to the mandatory.

qmail         - qmail (best damn mta on earth)
             
                - netqmail-1.05-libspf-1.0.0-RC5-HOWTO.html
                  - A step by step (with literal output) process of how
                    to patch netqmail-1.05 with libSPF.

                - tcpserver_vars.html
                  - A comprehensive explanation of the tcpserver variables
                    which libSPF adds which are available for use within
                    qmail and facilitate controlling the behaviour of
                    libSPF without ever touching a control file.

                - control_files.html
                  - A document that is similar to the tcpserver_vars 
                    document except that its focus is on explaining  all of
                    the available qmail control files that one can create
                    to facilitate controlling the behaviour of libSPF.

Sendmail      - Sendmail

                - sendmail-8.13.1+libspf-1.0-HOWTO.pdf 
                  - A step by step (with literal output) process of how to

                    having been patched with libSPF

spfmilter     - Sendmail 'spfmilter'

	        - A spfmilter config file example
		
Courier-MTA   - The Courier MTA
                - Documentation relative to patching Courier with libSPF.

spfqtool      - The libSPF Query Tool
                - The source code is available featuring syntax highlighted
                  HTML.  The goal of spfqtool is threefold:
                 
                  1) Provide an easy method to test libSPF for RFC compliance.
                  2) Provide would-be developers with an implementation
                     example of the libSPF API
                  3) Provide end-users with a tool to easy and powerfully test
                     their SPF published records for accuracy.
