libSPF CHANGELOG for versions 0.0.1 to 0.0.26:

.01  - creation
.02  - retrieving DNS records
.03  - check SPF version, examin ip4: mechanism
.04  - localhost check added to qmail-smtpd, added prefix checks
.05  - fixed memory leak in qmail-smtpd caused by abnormal termination
       of connection to smtpd or by normal "quit".  
       UTIL_expand_ip now looks for ip mechanisms with no cidr block
       supplied as the RFC says shall be interpreted as /32 which now
       occurs.
.06  - added support for MX mechanism.
     - policy main broken down into separate utility functions,
       and there are now separate functions to handle DNS queries for
       T_TXT and T_MX records.  I will likely clean that up a little bit
       in the near future.
     - barons makefile changes are added and now compiles flawlessly
       under obsd using gmake.  I will try to fix the makefile to work
       with regular make.
     - error reporting moved into error.c
.07  - added support for A mechanism
     - implemented cidr checks for MX mechanism
     - implemented negative prefix parse halts on all mechanisms
     - new file dns.c contains major DNS functions
.07.1- added url_encode() function to util.c
.08  - added support for PTR mechanism
     - this functionality is __BROKEN__ in linux when attempting to
       obtain additional hostnames assigned with a PTR lookup, but
       it works fine in BSD.
.09  - added support for INCLUDE mechanism
     - uses a dummy function UTIL_expand_macro which needs to be
       completed.
.10  - added support for EXISTS mechanism
.11  - added header prepending for qmail
     - moved qmail related files into new directory include/qmail
     - new file mta_qmail.c to handle header prepending 
.12  - removed linked list functions UTIL_list_add / 
       UTIL_list_destory as they are no longer needed and removed
       their structures from spf.h
     - Rewrote PTR parsing to use a custom query function to 
       properly handle multiple PTR records.
.13  - Added sendmail support (mta_sendmail.c) and a good portion
       of the header files from sendmail-8.12.10.  Also a modified
       copy of (main.c) and (srvrsmtp.c) will have patches made
       from them.  A copy of the config file is required because
       i'm hooking a created macro called {libSPF} in the 
       sendmail.cf file (as it would eventually be called).
.14  - added MACRO_expand. (macro.c) It is incomplete. All %{ type 
       macros are expanded to "DUMMY_EXPAND". Things like "% ", "%i" 
       and whatnot cause it to return NULL. The RFC says that those
       must be treated as literal.
.15  - added proper support for EXPLAIN and REDIRECT mechanisms.
       fixed memory error with PTR lookup
.16  - removed MACRO_freebuf function and moved the entire loop
       inside of MACRO_expand since its walking the list once
       anyways to concatenate the return string, might as well
       just do it all at the same time.
     - fixed 3 memory related bugs in MACRO_expand and removed
       the stub function (MACRO_process) and started to write it.
       it currnetly handles the major single char mechanisms, 
       but BE AWARE the library isn't necessarily populating all
       of the data in the peer_info structure yet.  for example
       i still haven't written the MX validate function.
.17  - cleaned up qmail-smtpd patch, thanks to Steve Misel for his
       contribution (using addr.s instead of arg which is already
       cleaned).
     - added 'passed null char' error dumping at function start in
       remainder of util.c functions.
     - rewrote most of macro.c, just not able to make it work.
     - split MACRO_process into intself and a separate function
       MACRO_eatmore to make it less nasty.
.18  - fixed logic error in PTR mechanism code
     - added more verbose debugging for PTR mechanism
     - accepted wayne's spfquery.c and debug output change.  spfquery
       binary will be made (make spfquery) which can then be used to
       stress test libSPF.  Known recursive hangs cpu, working on it.
     - done away with mta_MTA-NAME.c code, these single functions can
       now be located in the patches against the respective MTA.  The
       header string is now moved into the peer_info structure and is
       called received_spf.  The header is now populated from 
       SPF_policy_main.
     - peer_info struct no longer global
     - sendmail support broken for the moment until I fix the patch to
       work with a now non-global peer_info struct, and write it to 
       handle the move of header prepending.
.19  - fixed bug where connect from localhost would segfault
     - fixed typo in qmail patches
     - fixed bug(s) in PTR mechanism parsing
     - fixed logical parsing of PTR mechanism
     - fixed bug(s) in MX mechanism parsing
     - fixed bug(s) in MACRO_eatmore
     - fixed bug(s) in MACRO_expand
     - fixed bug(s) in MACRO_process
     - fixed memory leak in UTIL_rev_addr
     - fixed spfquery.c which I broke in 0.18
     - cleaned up spfquery.c a bit
     - added ERROR_nomem and ERROR_pton functions to error.c which now
       EXIT upon call passing error string to stdout.
     - header files from MTA no longer required during build.  
     - WITH_QMAIL and WITH_SENDMAIL flags deprecated and removed.
     - re-worked qmail patch to work with changes to API
       - SPF_init now takes remoteip and local host name again
       - SPF_close must be passed, and will return peer_info (freed)
       - SPF_get_header returns formatted Received-SPF header which 
         must then be free'd
     - implemented support for deprecated mechanism "default"
     - mta_generic.c renamed smtp.c
     - mta_generic functions renamed from MTA_* to SPF_*\
     - MTA_smtp_ehlo function removed, SPF_smtp_helo handles both
     - new file header.c contains functions which manipulate headers
     - new file explain.c contains explain rejection string gernation
     - peer_info structure switched helo, from, current_domain,
       mta_hname, r_ip, and explain to pointers that are now dynamically
       allocated.  See new util function UTIL_free().
     - Now passing tests 0-57, 60, 61, 64, 68-74, 76, 78, 82
     - 'make test' removed from make file
     - test.pl / test.txt moved into new direction 'tools'
     - removed makefiles folder, no longer necessary
     - Some other small changes I can't remember now.
.20  - fixed some off by one overwrites happening randomly during macro parse
     - fixed bug(s) in INCLUDE mechanism parsing
     - fixed bug(s) in EXIST mechanism parsing
     - fixed bug where emails failing still tagged as pass
     - renamed spf result codes to SPF_* for clarity
     - removed PREFIX enum
     - new structure containing header strings (spf_result_t), result strings,
       result codes, and lengths of those strings
     - added recursion checking (max 20) via spf_rlevel global var
     - fixed CIDR calculations which were suffering from 2 missing lines of code
       from a previous checkout which have been readded
     - fixed test.txt : rules: 104, 102, 101, 100 
     - Now passing tests 0-107, 109, 110, 112, 116, 118-120, 123, 124, 131,
       133, 134, 137, 138, 141-143
     - new tests results file called TEST_RESULTS
     - added support for new result types 'NEUTRAL' and 'NONE' and updated
       behaviour of 'UNKNOWN'
     - re-added sendmail diff's from 0.15 but don't work with current yet
     - accepted wayne's patches to spfquery.c and test.pl
     - updated spfquery.c to work with new changes in libSPF
     - other stuff probably forgotten
.21  - fixed bug in header placement (header ending in \r\n in stead of \n)
     - fixed extra space in qmail dynamic makefile causing it to fail makes
     - fixed bug in A mechanism when CIDR mask was specified
     - fixed bug in PTR mechanism (debug mode only, missing var in output)
     - fixed missing aliases loop in UTIL_a_cmp()
     - fixed bug in REDIRECT mechanism where certain queries would poo poo
       by overwriting memory.
     - added default explanation
     - added previously unknown about xR expansion macro
     - added previously overlooked s expansion macro
     - added support for p macro (validation of client hostname via PTR lookup)
     - NEW QMAIL FILES:
       - control/spfaction - controls action on SPF query result
       - control/spfbestguess - contains SPF query language
       - control/explainstate - toggle explanation output
       - control/spfexplanation - contains default explanation (can use macro)
       - control/spfguesstate - toggle best guess behaviour
       - control/spfheaderstate - toggle pre-pending Received-SPF headers
       - control/spftrustedforwarder - contains SPF query language
       - control/spftrustedstate - toggle querying of Trusted Forwarder
       - all information about this is in include/qmail/README and HOWTO
     - qmail status patch added (patch against qmail-showctl.c)
     - added new API function SPF_result for dealing with result string creation
     - added explanation output to qmail patch
     - added best guess support
     - added trusted forwarder support
     - added support for unknown mechanism in both header and result response
     - discovered that gethostbyname will not support '_' characters in hostnames
       will have to write a function to replace this like I seem to have had to
       do everywhere else...
     - Now passing tests 0-120, 122-124, 131, 133, 134, 137, 138, 140-143 
     - updated spfquery to work with changes to SPF_init
     - find qmail control files in include/qmail/control with default settings
     - added SPF logging function to generate a log (/var/log/spflog.txt) which
       outputs in the following format: 
       [YY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS] result : email [ip], spfver, depth, error (if any)
.22  - fixed bug in qmail-smtpd.c patch where free'd structure would result in
       MTA close with multiple destination addresses (contrib: Patrick Earl)
     - fixed bug in SPF_smtp_from where repeating MAIL FROM commands resulted
       in memory leak. (contrib: Patrick Earl)
     - Reworked qmail-smtpd.c patch to properly disable SPF checks when action is 0
     - enabled tarpitting in qmail patch
     - NEW QMAIL FILES:
         - control/spftarpit - toggle tarpitting
         - control/spftarpittime - how long to tarpit for
     - Fixed (AGAIN *sigh*) invalid prepend strings (terminated with \r\n\ instead
       of \n which causes MS mail clients to barf attachments into mail body and 
       subject/from show up blank).
.23  - fixed buffer overflow bug in debug code enforcing a limit upon possible
       debugging output.  A special thank you to Gregory Neil Shapiro for choosing
       to point this out in a post to the mailinglist and cheaply using it
       as an excuse not to integrate a patch into sendmail.  For the rest of
       class who aren't familiar with the correct methods of bug submission,
       one might want to inform the author on the off chance he might fix it.
     - fixed bug in PTR comparison where function returned FALSE by default instead of
       TRUE.
     - Thanks to Patrick Earl for pointing out that ptr:hostname would automatically
       pass any test due to the way the comparison was performed.  The discovery of this
       brought to light that the current tests do not check for this.  One should be added
       in the next release of tests.  libSPF also of course now performs a check for this
       and should work although is actually untested.
     - PTR domain.tld vs domain.tld comparisons are now case insensitive
     - Modified header output to comply with new RFC draft 2.9.7.
     - patch against sendmail-8.12.10 is rewritten basically, and is now fully functional.
       please see the HOWTO and README documents in the include/sendmail directory.
     - added new file FAQ which should handle some frequently asked questions
     - Now passing tests 0-127, 129, 132, 134, 135, 138, 139, 141-144 
     - ACTION responses softfail and fail have been reversed, such that fail is now 2
       and softfail is now 3.  This makes more sense, as we would want to fail on hard
       failures first, and softfailures second.  This is also reflected in the tarpitting.
.24  - fixed debian segfault bug when domain is a CNAME.  Thanks to Albert
       Weichselbraun <albert@atnet.at> for not only bringing this to our
       attention, but also supplying a patch.
     - fixed segfault bug when result was softfail.
     - fixed bug in qmail-smtpd.c, a definate must update for qmail users.
     - Implemented changes based on patches by Patrik Earl.  (More in 0.25)
     - major code cleanup first attempt.
       - spf.c -> main.c
       - merged header.c -> main.c
       - merged explain.c -> main.c
       - merged smtp.c -> main.c
       - removed error.c
       - header files for each source
       - spf.h now only contains globally accessable functions
       - moved spfquery to tools directory, wrote separate makefile
     - qmail patch updated to netqmail-1.05
     - qmail dynamic makefile updated
     - qmail static makefile updated
     - Sendmail patch updated
.25  - Applied patch from Teddy <teddy@teddy.ch> which fixes multiple issues discovered
       by himself with my sendmail patch.  In addition Teddy has fixed CNAME recursion,
       SASL, and some delay checks.
     - An un-applied AMD-64 patch from Jason Richey <jasonr@bomis.com> can be found
       in the patches/amd64 directory.
     - An un-applied SOLARIS patch from David Summers <david@summersoft.fay.ar.us> can
       be found in the patches/qmail directory.
     - Moved patches from include/MTA to patches/MTA to make more sense
     - Applied patch by Daniel Roethlisberger <daniel@roe.ch> to spfquery which fixes
       the missing -f support.  Daniel is also kindly managing the BSD ports.
     - Fixed whatever kludging happened in the qmail patch to cause it to not apply
       by rebuilding it from scratch.
.26  - Fixed misbehaviour in the macro parser when working on %% (would simply leave
       before and not finish the parse) (RM)
     - Fixed Parser TXT bug.  Its now more efficient and quicker to reject invalid
       TXT records (not containing SPF information) and no longer barfs "unknown
       mechanism".
