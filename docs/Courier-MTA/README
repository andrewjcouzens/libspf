Sorry there is currently no more information available about how
to patch Courier with libspf. 

I have consulted the author of the Courier patch and requested that
he make a HOWTO if possible.

If you would like to contribute a 'walkthrough' or 'HOWTO'
document please post it in the forums or E-mail it to me and
I will gladly include it with this project.
