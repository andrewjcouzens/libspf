SPF Query Tool (spfqtool)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The query tool is enabled and compiled by default.  If you do not wish for this
to be the case please return to the root of this package (cd ../../) and
re-run configure like so:

./configure --disable-debug --disable-debug-logfile --enable-paranoid-malloc 

Of course feeling free to append or prepend any other compilation flags you
may wish.

If you do enable debugging, add '-d 6' in with your queries and:
tail -f /var/log/spf.log.  This is where you will find all debugging output 
instead of to stderr or stdout.

Please ensure that whomever you are running 'spfqtool' as has appropriate 
writing permissions to /var/log.  Mode 0644 would be generally appropriate
depending on how anal retentive your system permissions are.
